# -My-First-LangGraph-Gemini-AI-Project
I just completed my first project using LangGraph âœ¨

The idea was simple but powerful:
ðŸ‘‰ Start with a blog title
ðŸ‘‰ Use Google Gemini AI to generate an outline
ðŸ‘‰ Automatically expand the outline into a complete blog post

This project gave me hands-on experience with workflow orchestration in LangGraph and the power of LLMs for content generation.

It feels great to see how AI can simplify something like blogging into just a few automated steps. Canâ€™t wait to build even more advanced workflows! ðŸš€
